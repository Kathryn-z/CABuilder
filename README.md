# CABuilder

## Description
CABuilder is an "app builder" program that allows developers to create a single-turn conversational app, or "CA". This is similar to creating a version of the Alexa Skills or Actions on Google platform that allows developers to create voice-controlled apps for Alexa or Google Assistant.

There are two types of people who can use CABuilder. A developer can store an app into the CABuilder database, and an end user can run any of the apps stored in the CABuilder database.
